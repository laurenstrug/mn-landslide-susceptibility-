University of Minnesota student project from GEOG 5541 Principles of Geocomputing to measure landslide susceptibility using lidar-derived DEM. This program takes DEM as input and outputs four datasets: two hillshades, slope, and aspect. There are two versions of this project

1. Master branch is open-source, using GDAL.
2. GIS5572 branch uses arcpy and was used to create a custom tool in ArcGIS Pro, which can be downloaded.
